            Probably inspired by one of the greatest sandwiches of all time - the leftover turkey sandwich - this is a burger that might not be everyone's first choice, but should definitely be one all burger lovers get to know. Turkey is a delicious, tasty and dry meat that is packed full of flavour, making it a perfect alternative to red meat for a burger patty. Try this recipe and never look back.
