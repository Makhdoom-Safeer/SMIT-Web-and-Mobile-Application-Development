</p>

<p>
<i>The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries.</i> The introduction of the pineapple to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. Since the 1820s, pineapple has been commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations.
