            Bakso ayam is a traditional dish and a type of bakso (meatball) originating from Indonesia. These meatballs are usually made with a combination of chicken, garlic, oil, salt, sugar, corn starch, and baking powder. The ingredients are shaped into chicken meatballs that are boiled in water.

            Once taken out of the pot, the meatballs are plunged into ice-cold water. They can be eaten as they are or incorporated into a delicious chicken meatball soup called sup bakso ayam. It's recommended to use lean chicken breast when preparing bakso ayam.
