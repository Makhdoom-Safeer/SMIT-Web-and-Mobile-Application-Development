            Home fries are a traditional type of American breakfast food. Home fries are made from potatoes cut into cubes or bite-size pieces, then they are pan fried in oil.

            These types of potatoes make a delicious dish for breakfast, or a good fry when you are looking for a type of fry that is not necessarily deep-fried.
