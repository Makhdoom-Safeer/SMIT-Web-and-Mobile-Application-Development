            The addition of cheese transforms a burger... into a cheeseburger. But all joking aside, it just makes sense to add a layer of cheese to your burger, whether it's blue cheese or cheddar, you can't go wrong. Try this recipe for the ultimate cheeseburger, which calls for umami-packed Parmesan cheese.
