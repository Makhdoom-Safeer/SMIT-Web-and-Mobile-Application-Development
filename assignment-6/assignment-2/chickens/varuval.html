            Varuval is a traditional Indian dish originating from Chettinad. It consists of spicy dry-fried pieces of chicken such as breasts or drumsticks. In order to prepare it, the masala spices such as cinnamon, cloves, fennel, coriander, cardamom, cumin, red chili, and black peppercorns are roasted in a pan until fragrant, then crushed or ground.

            The chicken pieces are marinated in a combination of turmeric and salt, then cooked with the ground masala spices, chili peppers, curry leaves, onions, ginger, garlic, and chopped tomatoes until the combination is nearly dry. Once done, varuval chicken is usually garnished with coriander leaves before serving, and it's often accompanied by paratha or rice on the side.
