        <p>
            Of all fish, salmon makes probably the best fish patty for a burger. The main thing to consider is the source of your salmon and in general, farmed salmon should be avoided, so if you can, get your hands on wild salmon and grind it down for a salmon burger. The addition of dill, capers, mayo and ginger takes this burger the highest level. This recipe for salmon burgers adds quinoa for texture.
