            Curly fries are a classic favorite. They are just as they sound. Curly fries are made from potatoes that are cut into a curly shape, sometimes you can find one that is curled so tight it looks like a spring. If you think of classic drive-ins or root beer stands, curly fries are likely one of the foods that come to mind that might be served there.

            Curly fries can still be found at some fast food restaurants, and they can also be found in the frozen section of your local grocery store.

            Curly fries can be prepared in a variety of ways, from deep frying them to baking them in your oven. Some fries may have a lot of seasoning on them and others could just be curly fries.
