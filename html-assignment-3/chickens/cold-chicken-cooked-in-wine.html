            Often dubbed a Shanghainese specialty, drunken chicken is, in fact, an authentic dish originating from the Zhejiang province. The main ingredients of this chicken dish are a fresh, whole chicken and Shaoxing wine, a renowned rice wine produced in Zhejiang province.

            Originally, the recipe calls for a whole chicken to be cooked, chilled in ice water, and then soaked in a Shaoxing wine-based marinade, overnight, or for 2-3 days. The chilled chicken is then cut into large chunks and traditionally served cold, covered with the wine-based marinade.
