            Ayam bakar is a traditional chicken dish originating from Indonesia, but it’s also popular in Malaysia. In order to prepare charcoal-grilled chicken, the meat is first simmered in a pot with bumbu or rempah spices, and the sauce is then reduced to a paste that’s applied to the chicken pieces before grilling.

            The meat is grilled until the skin develops a dark or black color and becomes caramelized, but not burnt. Once done, the chicken is served with steamed white rice, sambal terasi, tomato and cucumber slices, and a bit of kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce), which has already been used during the marinating process.
