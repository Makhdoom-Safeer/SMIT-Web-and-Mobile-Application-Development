        <p class="poem">
            I've searched my soul but hard as I've tried<br>
            I find my religion is "unclassified"<br>
            I believe in nature and laughter and love<br>
            And goodness and mercy and a God up above.<br>
            The sun and the rain and the winds that blow<br>
            And a hundred earthy things that I know<br>
            But I don't fit in, in a civilized way<br>
            To the rules and the customs that people say.<br>
            My heaven's on earth; it's the things that I share<br>
            With the whole human race-I really care.<br>
            when I'm gone and just ashes remain<br>
            I'll be part of the earth and the wind and the rain<br>
            It's my "everlasting"_ it seems right to me<br>
            In the big scheme of life, it's the way it should be.
        </p>

            Life has been good and I don't fear the night<br>
            It's part of God's plan and I know it's all right.
