            Chicken divan is a rich casserole made with chicken pieces, almonds, broccoli, and Mornay or hollandaise sauce. In the 1950s, it was the signature dish of a New York restaurant called the Divan Parisienne, hence the name.

            The inventor of the dish is a chef named Anthony Lagasi, who received an award from the New York Chatham Hotel for his creation. The dish might be additionally enriched with ingredients such as cheese, white wine, mushrooms, or water chestnuts, and it is recommended to serve it with bread and salads on the side.
