<h1>Orange</h1>

<p>
<b>An orange is a fruit of various citrus species in the family Rutaceae;</b> it primarily refers to Citrus × sinensis, which is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus × aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony); varieties of the sweet orange arise through mutations.
</p>

<p>
<i>The orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata).</i> The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo. The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced.
